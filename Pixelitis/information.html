	<h1><mark>Pixelitis</mark> 1.0</h1>
	<p>Have you ever found a dead or stuck pixel before? Are you having trouble showing others where it is? Well <mark>Pixelitis</mark> is for you!</p>
	
	<h2>What is a dead pixel?</h2>
	<p><mark>Pixelitis</mark> assists you in providing the optimal situation for finding those pesky little black or white dots, allows you to place a very obvious red marker on them, and remembers where they are for when it matters most.</p>
	
	<img src="infoDeadPixels.png" width="320" height="320" />
	
	<p>There are three types of pixel defects. The first, which usually appears as a black dot that never moves, is a <em>dead pixel</em>. The second type, which is usually seen as white (but may also be colored) against a black background, is called a <em>stuck pixel</em>. Finally, the last type is due to <q>scratching</q> of the LCD panel, and creates a sort of rainbow against a black background.<p>
	
	<h2>Tools</h2>
	
	<p><mark>Pixelitis</mark> provides you with several tools for you to find and possibly fix dead pixels. The toolbar at the bottom of the screen has the following functions: Fist Aid, Horizontal Sweep, Full Screen, Vertical Sweep, and Information.</p>
	
	<img src="infoToolBar.png" width="320" height="110" />
	
	<p>In the case of a stuck pixel, under some circumstances, the pixel can be repaired using the First Aid function, which cycles through several colors very quickly in an attempt to restore the pixel once and for all! This may only work in the event that the stuck pixel wasn't there before, and may not work in every case.</p>
	<p><mark><em>Note:</em> If you are susceptible to epilepsy, please do not use this function as it may be detrimental to your health.</mark></p>
	<p>To start finding dead pixels, use the Full Screen or Sweep functions. Tap the toolbar button a second time, or double tap anywhere on the screen, to swap between black and white backgrounds.<p>
	<p><em>Note:</em> Because dead pixels are a hardware malfunction, it is impossible for <mark>Pixelitis</mark> itself to locate them. Although <mark>Pixelitis</mark> will be of major assistance, it is up to you to find them.</p>
	<p>You can use the two sweep functions to scan your screen one line at a time, swiping your finder across the screen to move the indicator.</p>
	<h2>Marking Faulty Pixels</h2>
	<p>Once you find a dead pixel, press and hold until a target shows up. You can then drag the target around in real-time, or release your finger and nudge it around a single pixel at a time.</p>
	<p>If you need to nudge or remove an existing marker, simply press and hold it until it starts spinning.</p>
	<h2>Smudgy screens</h2>
	<p>If your screen becomes too smudgy to clearly see the underlying pixels, simply shake to lock the screen. You can then wipe off any smudges while your screen is still on. When finished cleaning the screen, shake again to re-engage <mark>Pixelitis</mark>.</p>
	
	<h2>Tips</h2>
	<p>The easiest way to find any dead pixels is to enter a dark room with little or no lights, and set the display brightness all the way up, while turning off auto-brightness. This will maximize the amount of light that will exit through the dead pixels from behind the black screen.<p>
	
	<p>If anything, <mark>Pixelitis</mark> will help you to show a technician where a dead pixel is located, improving your odds of getting it fixed! If not, your dead pixel adds character to your device, and who knows, it may fix itself over time :)</p>
	<h3>Enjoy, and Good Luck!</h3>
