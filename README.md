Pixelitis
======================

Purpose
-------

Pixelitis was an app once distributed on the App Store that helped users locate
and pinpoint dead pixels on iOS devices. However, after its second update, it was
hastily removed from the store by Apple. Since it will never be there again, here
is the code so others may learn from it, or even compile and use it themselves!
